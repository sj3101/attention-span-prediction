# attention-span-prediction
Machine learning model that predicts user attention span based on content type, length, and user interaction patterns.

**Attention Span Prediction (ML + Flask)**

This project predicts a user's attention span based on content characteristics such as content type, length, platform, device type, time of day, and interaction behavior.
It uses a trained Machine Learning model integrated with a Flask web app to generate real-time predictions through a simple and clean UI.

🚀 Features
Predicts attention span based on content metadata
Clean Flask-based web interface
Fully functional ML pipeline: preprocessing → model → prediction
Lightweight and easy to run locally
Ideal for research, analytics, and user-behavior modeling

🧠 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn (Model Training)
Flask (Deployment)
HTML/CSS (Frontend)

🎯 Purpose
The aim of this project is to understand digital behavior patterns and provide a predictive system that helps analyze which types of content keep users engaged.
